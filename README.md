# Affective Learning Ontology

## Description

The **Affective Learning Ontology** is an ontology developed to model the interaction between emotional states and digital learning objects, focusing on the field of affective computing in educational environments. This project aims to enhance the personalization and effectiveness of the learning process, considering students' emotions to create a more adaptive and engaging learning experience.

## Repository Structure

- **`ORSD.md`**: Requirements Specification Document for the Ontology (ORSD), containing the goals, classes, properties, and scope of the ontology.
- **`OntoUML/`**: Folder containing the `affectiveComputing.vpp` file, which can be opened in the Visual Paradigm software to view the OntoUML model of the ontology.
- **`OWL/`**: Directory with OWL files, including:
  - **`AffectiveComputing.owx`**: File that can be loaded in **Protégé** to explore and edit the ontology.
  - **`computingAffective.owl`**: File compatible with [WebVOWL](https://service.tib.eu/webvowl/), an online ontology visualization tool.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. View the Ontology in OntoUML

To explore the model of the ontology in OntoUML, use the `affectiveComputing.vpp` file:

- Open the **Visual Paradigm** software.
- From the menu, select "Open" and choose the `affectiveComputing.vpp` file from the `OntoUML` folder.
- This file contains the OntoUML diagram of the ontology, allowing a detailed visualization of concepts and relationships in a visual format.

### 2. View and Edit the Ontology in OWL

To explore and edit the ontology in OWL, use the `AffectiveComputing.owx` file:

- Open **Protégé** software (available at [https://protege.stanford.edu/](https://protege.stanford.edu/)).
- From the menu, select "Open" and load the `AffectiveComputing.owx` file from the `OWL` folder.
- Protégé allows you to examine the classes, properties, and instances of the ontology, making it easier to edit and test new relations and concepts.

### 3. View the Ontology with WebVOWL

For an interactive and online visualization, use the `computingAffective` file with the WebVOWL tool:

- Go to [WebVOWL](https://service.tib.eu/webvowl/).
- Upload the `computingAffective.owl` file from the `OWL` folder.
- WebVOWL provides an intuitive and interactive visualization of the ontology, allowing you to explore the relationships between concepts in a visual manner.

2. **View 2: Emotions of the Student**  
   Illustrates how emotions like **EmotionPositive**, **EmotionNegative**, and **EmotionNeutral** are associated with the student's profile in the ontology.

3. **View 3: Usage for Teaching**  
   Shows how the **Digital Learning Object** captures emotions from the student and adapts activities accordingly.
